1st project

// outside of not keeping score, and it breaking down on mobile devices,  I'm curious on feedback.  This is my 1st complet project that was directly from a course.  The majority of it is my own, though I referenced a Udemy course I'm taking and I noted where I took directly from a website.
// Ultimatly, I'd like some feedback on things that could've been improved or cleaned up.
// Also, I'm interested in how legible it is for someone else.  if items were organized well and the the comments were useful.  

// If you're still reading this, thank you for your time and 
//          ------------  let's go Jags! üêÜ
